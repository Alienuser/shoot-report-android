        <h2>Music activation</h2>
        <p>Are you often tired before a competition or training session and feel drained? There is a
            way to activate and motivate you through your ears. One or two song lengths are
            sufficient. These songs can be optimally integrated into your routine before your
            competition. In any case, you should choose the songs yourself. On the shooting range,
            headphones will help you to isolate yourself from everyone else and to activate
            yourself.</p>
