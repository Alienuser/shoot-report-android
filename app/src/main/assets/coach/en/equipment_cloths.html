            <h2>Shooting Jacket:</h2>
            <p>In the standing position, the shooting jacket serves as a support for your muscles
                during the holding work. Like a protective cover, it protects your back in
                particular. Thanks to its padding and pressure insulation, it also guarantees slip
                resistance at the contact points.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="tip">
            <h3>Tip:</h3>
            <p>You will find a large selection of high-quality shooting jackets in different price
                ranges in the Sauer Shooting Sportswear range, for example. The top model is
                certainly the "ADVANTAGE EXTRA", which provides excellent support for your muscles
                with its sturdy cotton-backed caoutchouc material. The caoutchouc is also extremely
                dimensionally stable and resistant to distortion, which makes it particularly
                durable. To prevent the support arm from slipping, this side is made of suede, which
                has particularly adhesive properties.</p>

                canvas and caoutchouc, the trousers are extremely resistant to distortion. The
                caoutchouc sections also provide you with optimum stability in your position. In the

            <p>With their special soles, which have an enlarged surface, the shooting shoes promote
                good impact balance, especially in the standing position. They also offer good grip
                on most surfaces. The lacing across your ankle stabilizes it, which reduces body

                combination with the individually adjustable tongue solution, your position feeling
                is further supported with these shoes. With the new PTU sole for better stability,

            <h2>Shooting Underwear:</h2>
            <p>Not all clothing is suitable as underwear under shooting jackets and trousers. In
                addition to the permitted maximum thickness of 2.5 mm, your shooting underwear
                should be tight-fitting and breathable. You should also make sure that there are no
                irritating seams in the areas of the support points, elbows and hips.</p>

            <h3>TIP:</h3>
            <p>The "X-Bionic" underwear from TEC-HRO has established itself as an excellent
                collection for shooting underwear. Different fabric structures ensure a perfect body
                climate, and muscles and joints are also supported. Special ventilation channels
                ensure a great evaporation rate in this shooting underwear and thus cools when you
                sweat - at the same time it warms when you are cold. The compression properties of
                this clothing can minimally reduce the pulse rate and feels like a second skin.</p>

            <h2>Shooting Gloves (Support Hand):</h2>
            <p>Your shooting glove of the support hand prevents slipping under the front-stock with
                its rubber pads. The front-stock is held in place by these rubber pads. When
                choosing your glove, you should always take a closer look at your hand position to
                decide which glove is right for you. Depending on the design, the glove can redirect
                the pressure on your wrist unfavourably or squeeze blood vessels. Shooting without a
                glove can also make sense depending on the positioning of the support hand.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="tip">
            <h3>TIP:</h3>
            <p>Partially inserted pads made of biogel in the glove provide ideal padding for your
                hand and at the same time allow your wrist to move freely. The "PREMIUM" glove model
                from Sauer Shooting Sportswear uses such pads. In addition, the inside of the glove
                is equipped with embossed leather, making the glove ideal for gripping the sports
                rifle. If you prefer to rest your rifle on your fist, the "TOP TEN" glove from Sauer
                Shooting Sportswear is more suitable for you. With its new caoutchouc moulded parts,
                your wrist is optimally stabilised and offers you a non-slip contact surface. Sauer
                Shooting Sportswear also has many other gloves in its range.</p>

            <p>With the shooting glove on your trigger hand and the rubber coating on the inside,
                you increase the connection between your palm and the grip. Especially when your
                palms are wet, the constant rubber coating facilitates a consistent grip on the
                grip.</p>

                such as "CONTACT IV" from Sauer Shooting Sportswear. Thanks to its breathable
                material combination and the silicone decor on the inside, the glove offers you a
                firm grip even in long and strenuous competitions and training sessions.</p>

                eye-shield is ideally light in colour to keep the contrast for the eye as low as
                possible. A frosted glass version of this eye-shield is the most comfortable
                solution for your eye. With a further shield in the side area of your aiming eye,
                the focus of the aiming can be increased even further. You can easily attach the
