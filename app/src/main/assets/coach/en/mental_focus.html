        <h2>Thought stop:</h2>
        <p>Do you have difficulty concentrating when shooting? Distracting thoughts can be stopped
            by the mental technique "thought stop". As soon as the distracting thought appears in
            your mind, call out loudly "Stop!" and imagine a stop sign. Then you breathe calmly
            again and put your concentration back on the goal.</p>
