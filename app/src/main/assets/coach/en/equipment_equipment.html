            <h2>Butt Plate:</h2>
            <p>The butt plate forms the connection between the sports equipment and your
                shoulder/upper arm area. For this purpose, the butt plate is adapted to the
                insertion position by means of individual adjustment options. The butt plate can be
                individually adjusted depending on the manufacturer and construction. The maximum
                height adjustment is determined by the construction. Adjustment to the right and
                left, parallel to the standard position, as well as turning in the vertical axis may
                not exceed 15 mm. The setting should be such that the butt plate fits over the
                entire surface of your shoulder to ensure firm body contact at all times. The
                passive pressure of your trigger hand on the grip creates the most important
                connection between the butt plate and the insertion point between the sporting
                weapon and your body.</p>

            <h3>TIP:</h3>
            <p>The "TEC-HRO fusion" butt plate from TEC-HRO is particularly flexible in its
                ergonomic and anatomic adjustment settings. You can easily adjust it to your
                insertion position in just a few steps to achieve an optimal fit. The narrow and
                particularly short design of the contact surfaces are an advantage for your feel.
                This butt plate from TEC-HRO is suitable for stock from many different
                manufacturers. You can easily and quickly retrofit the butt plate with the hook
                construction with two double joints for adjustment in three-position competition
                small bore.</p>

            <p>The cheek piece serves to support your head when looking centrically through the
                sights. The cheek piece should be adjusted so that your head and cervical spine are
                in an ergonomic position. For optimal positioning of your head, the cheek piece can
                be individually adjusted horizontally, vertically and in its inclination, depending

            <h2>Grip:</h2>
            <p>The size of the grip can vary depending on the manufacturer. The size must be
                individually adapted to your trigger hand in order to be able to grip the grip well.
                However, there must be no contact between the grip and your chest. The setting must
                therefore be chosen with some distance. As a guide to the grip position, the
                position of your foremost finger limb in relation to the trigger tongue is helpful.
                If possible, there should be a 90° angle between your first and third finger limb.
                (For triggers with a first pull, 90° for a first pull that has been overcome). When
                adjusting the grip, make sure that your wrist is not bent.</p>

            <h2>Handlebar:</h2>
            <p>Depending on the manufacturer, the handlebar can be adjusted horizontally, vertically
                and in its inclination. The width of the handlebar also depends on the manufacturer
                and type. When choosing the right handlebar, it is important to weigh up the
                requirements of the application. For example, some are suitable for the insertion of
                a hand stop for three-position competition, others rather extend the support surface
                for shooting on a rest.</p>

            <p>The trigger tongue may vary in size and shape depending on the manufacturer. The
                choice of the optimal shape is up to you. It is important that the optimal
                positioning of your first finger limb is always the same. Aids here are small tips
                or rubber nubs on the trigger to always achieve good repeatability. The settings of
                the trigger and the trigger weight, as well as the first pull of the trigger, are
                adjusted by means of set screws. More detailed information can be found in the

            <h2>Sight:</h2>
            <p>The so-called line of sight is defined by the straight line between your eye, the
                diopter, the front sight and the target image. If you rest your head optimally and
                look centrically through the diopter, the distance between your aiming eye and the
                diopter should be between 5 and 8 cm. If the distance is too small, aiming errors
                may occur. If the distance is too large, the light incidence will be too low. The
                distance can be adjusted individually by moving the diopter.</p>

        <section class="info">
            <h2>Diopter:</h2>
            <p>The diopter is used for precise adjustment of the hit point position. Depending on
                the manufacturer's design, the hit point position changes after turning the
                respective adjustment wheel in the horizontal or vertical plane. You have to find
                out for yourself how many clicks you have to turn per ring. With most diopters the
                rule is 3 clicks for each ring to be adjusted. This setting does not apply to
                diopters with a very fine adjustment rate.</p>

            <h2>Iris Aperture:</h2>
            <p>The iris aperture is the screw-in attachment on the diopter with the opening of the
                sight in the direction of the target image. With a small aperture circle, your view
                is sharpened. Depending on the manufacturer and design, the aperture circle can be
                widened or narrowed. The following applies: "The smaller the hole, the sharper but
                also fainter the target image appears". In order to be able to react optimally to
                the weather conditions on open shooting ranges, different colour settings are also
                possible, depending on the manufacturer's design.</p>

            <p>The sight raiser block is an aid to bring your head into an ergonomic position and
                still be able to look centrically through the diopter. For this purpose, spacers of
                the same height are pushed under the diopter and front sight tunnel, thus slightly
                raising the sighting line. Depending on the manufacturer, these can be adjusted in
                height and also horizontally. Care should be taken that the distance between the
                centre of the ring and the centre of the barrel does not exceed 6 cm.</p>

            <h3>TIP:</h3>
            <p>Damit du deine Visierlinie binnen Sekunden einfach und individuell verstellen kannst,
                The "TEC-HRO rapid" sight line from TEC-HRO is recommended so that you can adjust
                your sight line easily and individually within seconds. After installation, you no
                longer need any tools. The advantages of the new design save you valuable time
                during the conversion phases in the three-position competition and give you the
                opportunity for more test shots. The grid with scale shows you the set height and
                serves to reproduce the position for the respective discipline.</p>

            <h2>Front Sight Tunnel:</h2>
            <p>The front sight tunnel serves as orientation in the sighting in the centric
                arrangement of the system. The front sight tunnel is the holder for the front ring
                sight, the position can be adjusted on the rifle. With a maximum length of 50 mm and
                a maximum diameter of 25 mm, the front sight tunnel must not protrude beyond the
                barrel muzzle. A variation of the closed front sight tunnel is the open front sight
                tunnel, here the glass ring front sight and an orientation ring front sight, with a
                larger ring, are clamped into the holder. This type of front sight holder allows for
                a very beautiful and high-contrast target image.</p>

                simplest here are certainly the exchangeable rings that are inserted or screwed into
                the front sight tunnel. A more user-friendly variant is the adjustable ring front
                sight, which is screwed into the front sight tunnel and can be variably adjusted at

                With the help of additional weights you can achieve the optimal weight for you.
                Depending on the design, the additional weights can be attached to the barrel or the
                stock, but make sure that the centre of gravity of the sporting equipment always
                changes as well. When you place the rifle on your hand rest position, it should be

            <p>Shooting glasses serve as a visual aid in sport shooting, as in everyday life. In
                sport shooting, difficulties can arise, especially when aiming. One indication of
                the need for shooting glasses may be that you are unable to maintain your aiming
                concentration over the course of a competition. Blurring of the ring front sight and
                shooting mirror, as well as an unexplained hit pattern can also be signs. You should
                consult an optician who is experienced in the sport of shooting when having your
                spectacle lenses made. A telephone call to the optician will help you to gather all
                the necessary data, such as the length of your sighting line, in advance. As an
                alternative to shooting glasses, there is the possibility of attaching the lens to a
                headband or directly to the sport weapon with the help of a so-called monoframe. In
                any case, you should inform your optician before taking your sporting rifle with you

            <p>As the name suggests, a tripod to rest is used to rest the sports equipment. This
                refers to the rest of the sports equipment during loading and rest breaks. The
                elevated position of the tripod makes your lifting work and your action sequence as
                motionless as possible. It is not advisable to use a tripod for rest for side lever

            <p>Most air pistols offer the possibility of moving the front and rear sights on the

                range and simplify the triggering. The size of the rear sight and front sight is
                chosen by the shooter. As a general rule, large sportsmen tend to need wide rear
                sights and small sportsmen tend to need narrow rear sights. Depending on the
                manufacturer, adjusting the rear sight on the sporting rifle is simplified by a
                simple size adjustment. In this way, the light range of the sight can be adjusted
                directly to the light conditions of the various shooting ranges without the need for
                major changes and conversion times of the rear sight blade.</p>
