            <h2>Set-Up of the Positioning (Four Control Layers):</h2>
            <p>In the standing position, always build up your positioning from the bottom to the top
                via the four control layers (foot position, leg position, hip position and upper
                body/shoulder position). Your foot position forms the static foundation for your
                whole positioning. The foot pointing towards the target is therefore also called the
                "essential pillar".</p>

        <section class="tip">
            <h3>1 Foot Position:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Your foot position should be at least one shoulder width apart, with an angle
                    of about 90 degrees to the target. Depending on your height and the orientation
                    of the target, the distance can be increased.
                </li>
                <li>Standing smaller than shoulder-width apart tends to have a negative effect on
                    your stability. To support the positioning, your back leg is placed slightly
                    back.
                </li>
                <li>To minimise lateral sway, you should load the entire soles of your feet
                    evenly.
                </li>
                <li>To add stability to your positioning, you can turn the tips of your feet in
                    slightly. This creates a slight muscle tension and stretching of the cruciate
                    ligaments in the knee. This method can help you with variations in your
                    positioning.
                </li>
                <li>You can adjust the height of your zero point in the positioning by changing
                    the distance in the back foot. However, the "essential pillar", i.e. your foot
                    pointing towards the target, remains in the same position. Decreasing the
                    distance causes your zero point to shift downwards, increasing the distance
                    causes your zero point to shift upwards.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>2 Leg Position:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Your entire leg musculature should be relaxed, the basic body tension without
                    consciously tensing the muscles is optimal. Your knees are fully extended, but
                    without tensing.
                </li>
                <li>If you look at your front view, the "essential pillar", i.e. the leg that is
                    closer to the target, should be aligned very steeply. While the back leg is off
                    the centre of gravity. It is best to ask someone to take a photo of your front
                    view, then you can see your leg position best.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>3 Hip Position:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Parallel to the line of fire, move your hips towards the target. Depending on
                    your height and the weight distribution on your feet, your hips will find their
                    optimal position. However, the final position should not be shifted beyond your
                    front foot (essential pillar), otherwise strong body swaying can occur.
                </li>
                <li>Your hips carry the stability through your spine to your upper body, so you
                    should make sure that they are not twisted. A slight twist can still be
                    compensated for with the upper body. When looking at your positioning from
                    behind in the direction of the shot, only one leg should be visible. It is best
                    to ask someone to take a photo of your side view, then you can see your hip
                    position best.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>4 Upper Arm/Shoulder Position:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>With your upper body leaning back slightly and your shoulder girdle turned in
                    towards the target, you offer enough space to hold your rifle. A relaxed
                    posture, without pulling up your shoulder, creates a perfect basic position that
                    does not strain your back muscles. Your upper body slumps into a comfortable
                    position and is relaxed by your abdominal breathing.
                </li>
                <li>Both of your shoulders are completely relaxed during the stroke. The shoulder
                    facing the target is slightly tilted towards the target, while the back shoulder
                    is only slightly lowered. If you look more closely, both shoulders are at the
                    same height. This results in a horizontal line between your right and left
                    shoulder. With tall shooters it is difficult to establish the horizontal line.
                    It is best to ask someone to take a photo of your back view, then you can see
                    your shoulder position best.

            <h2>Position of the Rifle (Four Control Points):</h2>
            <p>The insertion of your rifle is optimally positioned via the four control points,
                shoulder/upper arm, support arm/support hand, trigger hand and head rest.</p>

        <section class="tip">
            <h3>1 Shoulder/Upper Arm:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The butt plate is used to create the connection between your shoulder/upper
                    arm and your rifle. To do this, you should use your butt plate over its entire
                    length and adjust it to the insertion position. Also to create a firm connection
                    and the most important frictional connection between the rifle and you as the
                    shooter. Your rifle is pulled by a passive pull from your trigger hand on the
                    grip into your shoulder and thus forms the frictional connection.
                </li>
                <li>You have two options when inserting your butt plate.<br>
                    1. you place it in the bend between the upper arm and the torso, which allows a
                    very firm connection and a good head position.<br>
                    2. you place it in the hollow between the shoulder joint and the biceps, which
                    leads to a more comfortable feel and more fine control.


                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>2 Supporting Arm/Supporting Hand:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The "upper part of the essential pillar" is your supporting arm. Your forward
                    hip is chosen as the point of contact for the elbow of the support arm. You can
                    position your elbow optimally above your hip bone. The rifle should be supported
                    without muscle power in the upper arm. Therefore, when viewed from the front,
                    your support arm sits vertically under the muzzle of the barrel to support the
                    weight as a "essential pillar".
                </li>
                <li>When positioning your support hand, make sure it is not too close to the
                    trigger and not too far from the front-stock. Too close to the trigger can cause
                    tension in your muscles. In addition, a top-heavy rifle tends to become unstable
                    and slip out of your shoulder. Too far on the front-stock results in a wide
                    angle between your upper and lower arm, which can overload your muscles and lead
                    to muscle tremors.
                </li>
                <li>The choice of your optimal hand position depends on several factors. Your
                    height and the length of your neck, as well as the use of a height-adjustable
                    hand rest and a sighting line elevation play a major role. Basically, if your
                    head is in an optimal position and you can see through the sights without any
                    problems, the hand rest should be chosen. You should not feel any pain in the
                    supporting hand even over a whole shooting series.
                </li>
                <li>In practice, smaller shooters tend to rest the rifle on their fist and stand
                    in the lower position, while taller shooters shoot the rifle in the flat of
                    their hand in the upright position. You can find out which hand position is
                    optimal for your support hand and your stop over the course of several training
                    sessions.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>3 Trigger Arm/Trigger Hand:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The grip of your rifle should be well enclosed in the palm of your hand. A
                    grip that is too small or too large can lead to trigger malfunctions. You should
                    grasp the grip with an even, medium to high firmness. This grip strength creates
                    a passive tension on your naturally applied arm. Pulling the grip closer also
                    happens passively rather than actively.
                </li>
                <li>The wrist of your trigger hand should always be extended. Your bent wrist can
                    be positioned straight by adjusting the grip or the trigger blade. Make sure
                    that your trigger finger is always guided freely and that you position the
                    trigger blade centrally on the first phalanx.
                </li>
            </ul>

                </a>
            </p>
            <h3>4 Head Rest:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The placement of the head on the cheek piece is very important for your
                    stability as well as for your aiming process and must therefore always be
                    positioned exactly. Under its own weight, your head is slowly positioned on the
                    cheek piece; you should feel the cheek piece over your cheekbones.
                </li>
                <li>In order to look centrically through the sights without any problems, you have
                    the option, in addition to using a sight raiser block, of tilting the rifle
                    slightly towards your head and tilting your head slightly towards the sights
                    without straining your neck and throat muscles.
                </li>
                <li>When viewed from the outside, the cheek piece must be adjusted so that your
                    ear, eye and sight, when aiming, are in an imaginary line.
                </li>

            <h2>Alignment with the Target (Zero Point):</h2>
            <p>Aligning your positioning with the target, taking into account all control planes and
                points, is the crucial bridge to delivering the perfect shot via your sequence and
                sighting.</p>

            <h3>TIP:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Find the centre of the target at the shooting range. In the case of straight
                    cable systems, you can orientate yourself by the centre cables. With electronic
                    systems you should look at the centre of the target at some distance from the
                    shooting range and find the centre. It is always helpful to have a small marker
                    on the shooting stand. If this is not available, you can make your own mark to
                    find the centre when you leave the shooting range.
                </li>
                <li>Align yourself with your hip axis parallel to the shooting axis perpendicular
                    to the centre of the target, which you have found out beforehand. This is called
                    a "rough lateral alignment".
                </li>
                <li>Now take the recommended foot position and insert the rifle. In this
                    situation, you must adjust your position slightly to align the entire system
                    with the centre of the target. As on a turntable, you should make minimal
                    rotational movements of the entire system.
                </li>
                <li>When setting up, always consider the entire system: because foot and hip
                    position as well as the posture of the head always influence each other.

            <p>The inner positioning is characterised by the fact that only you can evaluate whether
                everything fits perfectly. The invisible inner positioning refers to your body
                feeling, the tension of your muscles. Together with the state of stretch of your
                ligaments and the position of your body parts in relation to each other, you have to

            <h2>Zero Point Check:</h2>
            <p>With the so-called zero point check you can check whether your inner and outer
                positioning are optimally aligned in relation to the target. To check this, you can
                repeat the following sequence several times and reposition yourself if necessary.
                You should carry out the zero check several times during each set-up phase and also
                during each firing sequence in order to be able to react to slight changes.</p>

                </li>
                <li>In the normal positioning you stand slightly turned in, approx. 60-65 degrees
                    to the target. With the arm stretched out towards the target, the neck muscles
                    are not so strained because the body and head are already slightly turned
                    towards the target.
                </li>
                <li>With the open positioning you stand more turned in, approx. 45-50 degrees to
                    the target. With the arm stretched out towards the target, the strain on the
                    neck muscles is very low.
                </li>
                <li>With the extremely open firing position, you stand almost frontally to the
                    target, which leads to an absolutely straight head position with the arm
                    stretched out towards the target. With this type of aiming, however, it should
                    be noted that the line of sight between the front sight, the rear sight and the
                    aiming eye is the smallest and your wrist is slightly bent.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>1 Foot Position:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Your feet should be placed at least one shoulder width apart.
                </li>
                <li>Your weight should be evenly distributed on both soles of your feet while your
                    knees are fixed with a natural basic tension. Your shoes should have a straight
                    sole in order to use as much of the foot surface as possible.
                </li>
                <li>By turning your toes in, you can regulate slight variations in your body.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>2 Body Posture:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Your body posture should be aligned upright to bring your centre of gravity to
                    the middle of your standing area.
                </li>
                <li>With a slight backward movement you can also balance the weight of the pistol
                    and position the body's centre of gravity correctly. Note, however, that a
                    strong backward tilt can cause damage to the health of the intervertebral discs
                    and also creates a very unstable positioning.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>3 Arm Position:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Your arm with the pistol in your hand is stretched, fixing the wrist and arm
                    joint to guarantee the same distance to the aiming eye. Together with your
                    shoulder they form your line of sight. Keep your shoulder in a relaxed natural
                    position.
                </li>
                <li>Your free arm should always be fixed in the same position. Find a position in
                    which no pendulum movement of the arm is possible. For example, the pocket of
                    your trousers is a good place. If you do not always wear the same trousers when
                    shooting, you should consider using a belt on the waistband of your trousers
                    that is always in the same place. With your free arm, you should also keep your
                    shoulder relaxed and adopt a natural posture.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>4 Head Position:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Make sure that your head position and your view over the sights are always the
                    same. In order not to negatively influence your sense of balance, you should
                    always position your head straight in order to obtain optimal visual acuity.
                </li>
                <li>The rotation of your head should always be painless in order not to damage the
                    neck muscles. In case of discomfort, you should take a closer look at the types
                    of positionings and choose a different type of firing position that is more
                    open.

            <h2>Insertion of the sporting equipment:</h2>
            <p>Since the pistol is held with one hand, the fit of your pistol grip is very important
                for inserting the sporting equipment into your hand. You should be able to grip the
                pistol grip well and the grip should form a positive connection with your hand. By
                applying the undergrip adjustment, the grip can be adjusted so that the main load is
                taken by the middle finger. Ideally, the hand should be positioned "sucking" into
                the grip.</p>

            <h2>Inner positioning:</h2>
            <p>The inner positioning is characterised by the fact that only you can evaluate whether
                everything fits perfectly. The invisible inner positioning refers to your body
                feeling, the tension of your muscles. Together with the state of stretch of your
                ligaments and the position of your body parts in relation to each other, you have to
                find your optimal comfortable position in the positioning.</p>

            <h2>Zero point check:</h2>
            <p>With the so-called zero point check you can check whether your inner and outer
                positioning are optimally aligned in relation to the target. To check this, you can
                repeat the following sequence several times and reposition yourself if necessary.
                You should carry out the zero check in every set-up phase and also between shots in
                order to be able to react to slight changes.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Slowly guide the pistol into the holding area below the mirror and stand there
                    calmly.
                </li>
                <li>Slowly lower your gaze, making sure that your head remains in the target
                    position. Breathe in and out slowly and continuously.
                </li>
                <li>Turn your gaze back towards the sights and check whether the position of the
                    pistol in the holding area has changed.
                </li>
                <li>You can make any deviations using the positioning correction.
                </li>
                <li>Repeat the process several times until the front sight and target are
                    perfectly aligned.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>In any case, carry out the positioning check several times in succession in order to
                carry out the correct positioning correction.</p>

            <h2>Positioning correction:</h2>
            <p>You can change and correct your zero point via several factors. Note that only fine
                corrections are meant here. Coarse changes of the fence to the firing axis are made
                by adjusting the whole positioning to the right or to the left.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="tip">
            <h3>Change the position of the feet:</h3>
            <p>To correct slight changes in the lateral malposition, you can rotate your positioning
                over the legs. As on a turntable, you should make minimal rotational movements of
                the whole system.</p>
            <h3>Adjusting the height:</h3>
            <p>You adjust the height automatically with every positioning through your breathing.
                Make sure that your breathing is always the same in order to achieve the highest
                possible repetition accuracy.</p>
            <p>Under no circumstances should you make a correction via the wrist, as this will make
                the positioning unstable and can lead to runaways in the shot delivery.</p>
